      <p>Hello, friends! Welcome to my little portfolio page. There isn't much going on here at the moment, but with time I hope to expand the page with some beautiful projects. First of all, I will be linking you to some of my previous tasks that I have finsihed for this web development course I'm taking. I will also provide you with screenshots of them. Thank you for joining me on my journey!</p>

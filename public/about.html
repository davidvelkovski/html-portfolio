<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is David and I have just begun my journey to becoming a web developer. I find it very interesting, and I hope to design some beautiful websites in the future.</p>

<p>A little about me. I love reading books, and I also dabble in some writing. I hope to one day have my work published so that it can be available to everyone across the world. I love listening to music, gaming, hanging out with friends, and taking walks and hikes.</p>

<p>And that's a little about me. I still don't feel comfortable to share more, but with time I hope to be more open! Thank you again for checking my page out, it means a lot.</p>
